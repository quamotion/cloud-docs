Scheduling a monitoring script
==============================

Once you've installed your Device Hub, connected a device to your Device Hub, and started the
Device Hub agent, you can run scripts on your Device Hub.

To schedule a script, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your Quamotion Cloud account.
2. Click the *Schedule*  tab
3. In the *Schedule a new job* section, select the job you want to schedule, the device on which
   you want to run the job, and the schedule you want to run the job on. Then, click *Schedule this job*
4. The job will now appear in the list of scheduled jobs, and will start on your device shortly.
